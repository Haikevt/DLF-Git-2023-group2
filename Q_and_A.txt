Tom - Did you like Nikos?       62223e3aa4408d3394de11e0551dc2698f221c65
He is one of my best friends... Ohh you mean like that, wel uhm, no? But I do think someone liked him, he told me someone said they liked him and said their longed for his message. They also called him a very good president of the board. I don't think Ava liked that. Still don't know who it was, I am curious though. You know, opposites attract.	62223e3aa4408d3394de11e0551dc2698f221c65

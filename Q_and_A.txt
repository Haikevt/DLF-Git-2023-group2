- Everyone was already active and seemingly freinds. Our first trip as candidate board was therefore very special. It was on the Burcht in Leiden. We went eating icecream together an due to the circumstances at the time it was dubious if we were allowed to with six. At some point a photographer came by and made photo's of us specifically. Ava and Tom zijn ran towards him, after which this man gave a faulty lecture about press freedom.

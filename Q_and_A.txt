Tom - Did you like Nikos?       62223e3aa4408d3394de11e0551dc2698f221c65
He is one of my best friends... Ohh you mean like that, wel uhm, no? But I do think someone liked him, he told me someone said they liked him and said their longed for his message. They also called him a very good president of the board. I don't think Ava liked that. Still don't know who it was, I am curious though. You know, opposites attract.	62223e3aa4408d3394de11e0551dc2698f221c65

Yes, the FYA, bus specifically FYA-water, cause the FYA-fire did not count. 	47bf135f54fcc8e042512cb16005ce89a9788ec7

How is the atmosphere in the board?       3dbc9559cc5b9d35965c42d0854552374c2788ad
Fine, got a fun story about that. When we signed up, both Nikos and Meili told me they both thought the other were not sure about doing board with the other as they both thought the other did not like them.	3dbc9559cc5b9d35965c42d0854552374c2788ad


Did you throw beers?	3daea4ffc9f2e319ef2427d8bcd51fc21df87021
No, and I know Nikos did not either, but I know he took food from the food cabinet.	3daea4ffc9f2e319ef2427d8bcd51fc21df87021
